        <h3>Bio:</h3>
        
        <p>I grew up in small town arkansas, quite Literally. My towns population was 80, and my High School is now closed because there just weren't enough kids in the surrounding towns to keep it open. Once I graduated in 2010 I worked for 2 years as an AT&T customer support representative in the nearby bigger town. It looks a little more like a city now than it did growing up. </p>

        <p>In 2012 I joined the U.S Army and went on to work as an Information Technology Specialst for the next 6 years. I deployed to Afghanistan in 2016, and was Honorably discharged in 2018. I then moved back home and started attending college classes for Automotive Service Tech. I completed that course in 2019 and went back early 2020 for Collision Repair, of which I only completed 1 class before Covid19 hit. I'm currently engaged to a wonderful woman and living in a small apartment getting ready to start this next chapter of my life.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
        <p>I enjoy working on cars, and driving them fast. I love video games and coding as well. </p>
